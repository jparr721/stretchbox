# Stretchbox v2
ðŸš€ Elasticsearch local docker env for testing goodness

## What is this?
A local elasticsearch cluster with an exposed REST API for use with testing code etc without needing to worry about building your own interface or setting up anything fancy.

## Why?
Sometimes clusters are down, or server access is limited, this helps the developer keep his hands warm and writing code. Also because I need it for work and figured other people might like it.
Also, I replaced the Nodejs version with Golang because Go is faster and I like it.

Fly on space cowboys. ðŸš€
